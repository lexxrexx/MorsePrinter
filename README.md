## Overview

This project listens to a ham‑radio frequency with an **RTL‑SDR**, demodulates the signal, decodes Morse code, and prints the resulting conversation on a **thermal receipt printer** (ESC/POS compatible).

*   A 15‑second rolling buffer is always kept.
*   When a line containing the configured call‑sign is heard, the script _does not print it immediately_. It waits for a **response** – any line that does **not** contain the same call‑sign.
*   Upon the first response:
    1.  The rolling buffer (minus any lines that still contain the call‑sign) is flushed to the printer (lead‑in).
    2.  The response line itself is printed.
    3.  All subsequent lines are printed in real‑time until a QSO‑termination token (e.g., `73`, `SK`, `RR`, `DIT DIT`) is detected.

If the filter is disabled, every decoded line is printed immediately (original behaviour).

## Hardware Requirements

| Device | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| USB RTL‑SDR dongle (e.g., NooElec NESDR) | Receives the RF carrier. |
| Thermal receipt printer (ESC/POS compatible, e.g., Epson TM‑T20II) | Prints the decoded conversation. |
| Ubuntu server (18.04 + recommended) | Runs the software stack. |

## Installation Instructions

### Automatic install (via `install.sh`)

An `install.sh` script is included in the repository. It performs a one‑click setup:

```
# Download and run the installer in one step curl -L https://github.com/lexxrexx/MorsePrinter/raw/main/install.sh | bash 
```

The script will:

1.  Download the latest source archive from GitHub.
2.  Install all required `apt` packages.
3.  Install the required Python packages.
4.  Create a default `config.yaml` (if one does not exist).
5.  Make `morse_printer.py` executable.

### Manual install (step‑by‑step)

```
# 1️⃣ Update the system sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
2️⃣ Install required system packages

sudo apt-get install -y rtl-sdr sox multimon-ng python3 python3-pip unzip wget
3️⃣ Install required Python packages

pip3 install --upgrade pip pip3 install python-escpos pyyaml
4️⃣ Clone the repository (or download the zip)

git clone https://github.com/lexxrexx/MorsePrinter.git cd MorsePrinter
5️⃣ Make the main script executable

chmod +x morse_printer.py
6️⃣ (Optional) Create a default config file if you don’t have one yet

cat > config.yaml <
```

``   ***  ## Configuration File (`config.yaml`)  Place `config.yaml` in the same directory as `morse_printer.py`. Example:  ``` filter_enabled: true # true → conversation mode, false → print every line call_sign: "K1ABC" # the call‑sign that must be responded to  ```  *   `filter_enabled` (boolean) – When `true` the script uses the rolling‑buffer / response logic. When `false` it prints each decoded line immediately. *   `call_sign` (string) – The exact call‑sign (case‑insensitive) that triggers the “wait‑for‑response” state.  ***  ## How It Works  1.  **Rolling buffer**: Stores every decoded line with a timestamp for the last 15 seconds. 2.  **Call‑sign detection**: When a line contains the configured call‑sign, the script sets `awaiting_response = True` and does not print. 3.  **Response detection**: The next line that does _not_ contain the call‑sign is treated as the response. At that moment:     *   The rolling buffer (minus any lines still containing the call‑sign) is flushed to the printer (lead‑in).     *   The response line is printed.     *   The script enters `printing_active = True` and prints every subsequent line in real‑time. 4.  **Termination detection**: When a line matches any token in the termination list (`73`, `SK`, `RR`, `DIT DIT`, …) the printer cuts the paper, the state resets, and the script returns to idle monitoring. 5.  **Filter disabled**: If `filter_enabled: false`, the script skips all of the above logic and simply prints each line as it arrives.  ***  ## Running the Program  ``` cd ~/MorsePrinter # or wherever you placed the files ./morse_printer.py  ```  You should see console output such as:  ``` 🔧 Filter enabled – waiting for a response to 'K1ABC'. 🛰️ Listening for Morse… Press Ctrl‑C to stop. 📡 Received: K1ABC CQ CQ DE K1ABC 📡 Received: K2XYZ DE K1ABC 599 📡 Received: K1ABC 73  ```  The printer will receive the lead‑in (the 15 seconds before the response), then print the response and all following traffic until the `73` terminates the QSO.  ***  ## Troubleshooting  | Problem | Possible Cause | Solution | | --- | --- | --- | | No output on the printer | Incorrect USB IDs or missing permissions. | Run `lsusb` to get the correct IDs, update the script, and ensure your user is in the `lp` group or run with `sudo`. | | Script never detects a response | The call‑sign in `config.yaml` does not exactly match the transmitted call‑sign. | Double‑check spelling and remove surrounding whitespace. | | All lines are printed immediately (filter seems ignored) | `filter_enabled` is set to `false` or the config file isn’t being read. | Confirm `config.yaml` is in the same directory and contains `filter_enabled: true`. | | High CPU usage | Very high sample rate or noisy signal. | Lower the gain or sample rate in the script (variables `GAIN` and the `-s` argument to `rtl_fm`). |  ***  ## License & Credits  *   **License:** MIT – feel free to modify, redistribute, or incorporate into larger projects. *   **Core libraries:**     *   rtl_sdr – Osmocom Project     *   sox – SoX Team     *   multimon-ng – Multi‑Mode Decoder project     *   python-escpos – Daniel R.
